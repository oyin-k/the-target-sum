# The Target Sum

Built from a short tutorial by Samer Buna.

The game is simple:  you start with a random number in the header, the target , and a list of random challenge numbers below that target (the six numbers). Four of the six random numbers used above add up exactly to the target sum. Picking the correct subset of numbers is how you win the game.
